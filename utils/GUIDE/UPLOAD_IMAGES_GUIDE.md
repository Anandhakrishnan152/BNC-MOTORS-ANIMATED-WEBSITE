# ✅ How to Upload Colored Images - Complete Guide

## The Code is Ready!

I've already updated the code to automatically show the correct colored image when you click a color. Now you just need to upload your colored bike images.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Colored Images

Create/edit 12 images (4 colors for each of the 3 bikes) with different colored chassis.

### Step 2: Name Your Images EXACTLY Like This

**CHALLENGER S110:**
- `challenger-blue.jpg` ← Electric Blue chassis
- `challenger-red.jpg` ← Crimson Red chassis
- `challenger-black.jpg` ← Midnight Black chassis
- `challenger-white.jpg` ← Pearl White chassis

**BNC PERFETTO:**
- `perfetto-black.jpg` ← Midnight Black chassis
- `perfetto-red.jpg` ← Racing Red chassis
- `perfetto-blue.jpg` ← Ocean Blue chassis
- `perfetto-silver.jpg` ← Silver Metallic chassis

**BNC THE BOSS:**
- `boss-green.jpg` ← Emerald Green chassis
- `boss-black.jpg` ← Stealth Black chassis
- `boss-grey.jpg` ← Titanium Grey chassis
- `boss-white.jpg` ← Arctic White chassis

### Step 3: Upload to /public Folder

Place all 12 images in:
```
c:\Users\bablu\Downloads\bnc-motors\public\
```

### Step 4: That's It!

Once the images are uploaded, the website will automatically:
- ✅ Show the correct colored bike when you click a color
- ✅ Work on ModelShowcase (home page)
- ✅ Work on Shop page
- ✅ Work on BikeDetailPanel

## How It Works

When you click a color (e.g., "Crimson Red"):
1. The ColorSelector updates the selected color
2. The code looks up the image path for that color
3. The BikeImageWithColor component displays the correct image
4. **The bike changes to show the red chassis!**

## File Format

- ✅ `.jpg` (recommended)
- ✅ `.png` (also works)
- ✅ `.webp` (also works)
- ✅ `.avif` (also works)

Just make sure the file extension in the name matches the actual file type.

## Testing

After uploading:
1. Refresh your browser
2. Click different color options
3. Watch the bike image change to the correct color!

## Current Status

✅ Code updated with correct image paths
✅ Color selector working
✅ Image switching logic ready
⏳ Waiting for you to upload the 12 colored images

Once you upload the images, everything will work automatically!
